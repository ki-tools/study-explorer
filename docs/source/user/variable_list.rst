Variable List
=============

The variable list page provides an overview of all the existing
variables for each :ref:`domain` and qualifier.

The panel on the left will let you select the domain or qualifier you
want to view the variables for. You can then query the existing
variables by searching using the autocompleting text field or if the
domain also has a category using the dropdown menu. Once you have made
a selection simply hit ``Submit`` to update the view.
