Study Explorer
==============

The Study Explorer allows the user to explore a catalogue of studies
and associated observations. It provides a reuseable framework for
indexing any number of studies along with relevant metadata, and
enables customizable filtering leading to overviews of selected
studies.

It consists of four main components:

* A :ref:`study_filter` page to filter and query
  studies by their attributes and observations.
* A :ref:`study_explorer` to view the observations associated with the
  selected studies
* A :ref:`study_list` to view a table of all the indexed studies.
* A :ref:`variable_list` to view all the imported :ref:`domain` and
  qualifier variables.

This documentation will provide an overview about how to use the Study
Explorer to search and discover studies and secondly how to set up,
configure and deploy such a server.
